# Specjal Map

This is just a simple, static project based on Leaflet to showcase photos me
and my pals are taking around the world, drinking [Specjal
beer](https://www.specjal.pl). See it in action at
[https://dulek.github.io/specjal-map/](https://dulek.github.io/specjal-map/).

## How it works

The code is in index.html, markers data goes into markers.js, in a pretty
self-explanatory format.
