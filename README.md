# Specjal Map

This is just a simple, static project based on Leaflet to showcase photos me
and my pals are taking around the world, drinking [Specjal
beer](https://www.specjal.pl). See it in action at
[https://dulek.github.io/specjal-map/](https://dulek.github.io/specjal-map/).

## How it works

The code is in index.html, markers data goes into markers.js, in a pretty
self-explanatory format.

## Marker Preparation Tool

We've created a tool that allows you to easily prepare JSON files for creating markers on the map. To use the tool, follow the steps provided in the [Map Marker Preparation Tool README](./json-tool/README.md). This tool works best when your photos contain EXIF data with GPS information.
